	<h3>Going with Commission</h3>
	<hr>
	<p>God was not surprised by sin, but planned to buy back the world through his own 
	   sacrificial love. God has always been on mission. Until the great and terrible day
	   of the Lord when the books will be open and all will be judged according to what 
	   they have done, the Spirit is working in the world. We don’t do mission for God, 
	   but we are invited to join him as he does mission. We have real work to do and 
	   have important participation in his redemptive story, but the Lord carries the 
	   burden and accomplishes the goal of seeking and saving the lost. </p>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="value">Prayer:</span> God answers prayer and often for the sake of showing a watching world 
			his love and grace. Praying for lost people and with lost people is an 
			important part of our joining Jesus in his mission. Being lead by the 
			Spirit and letting the power of God flow through us to a lost and hurting 
			world is key to our going in Christ’s commission. (Acts 3)</li>
		<li><span class="value">Service:</span> The good news is not only words but action. Our service is a living 
			expression of the kingdom of God. We are God’s hands and feet to a hurt and 
			suffering world. God will give his people wisdom, power, and provision to 
			care for it. (James 1:26-27)</li>
		<li><span class="value">Collaboration:</span> Partnership with other churches and ministries is a way to 
			multiply the resources of the kingdom. Partnership with others who are serving 
			the real needs of the community is a wonderful way to build bridges with those 
			who would not otherwise connect with the church. We are better together. 
			(1 Peter 2:11-12) </li>
