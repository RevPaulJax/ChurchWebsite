	<h3>What We Believe</h3>
	<hr>
	<ul>
		<li>We believe that we are all broken, sinful people that are restored to wholeness 
			by the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</li>
		<li>Part of the wholeness that God desires for us is found through participation in 
			a church body that comes together as a community of worship.</li>
		<li>We worship God as he has revealed himself in Scripture and the world around us.
			We believe that Jesus is the rightful king of the universe, and his kingdom is 
			established wherever he is recognized as king!</li>
		<li>We believe in partnership with other churches and organizations in the area that 
			serve the needs of Jacksonville.  God is at work at this very hour, and we seek 
			to extend his kingdom by joining him and those doing his work around us.</li>
		<li>As we endeavor to extend God’s kingdom all areas of life, we have found that 
			rootedness in historic Anglican worship helps us hold fast to what is most 
			important in a culture where this has become increasingly difficult.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>What is Anglicanism?</p>
	</div>
	<p>The Anglican Church is rooted in a historic, worldwide faith, reaching back to the 
	history of England. The Anglican church holds to Protestant beliefs while still 
	incorporating some of the church's valuable Catholic traditions that have been in place 
	for over two millennia. We are a communion of churches that recognize the Bible as the 
	infallible word of God. The Apostles and Nicene creeds, the 39 Articles of Religion, 
	and the Book of Common Prayer connect us and keep us accountable to God's Word; they 
	help anchor us as we contextualize our faith in non-traditional ways. Incarnation Jax 
	is part of <a href="https://www.gulfatlanticdiocese.org">the Gulf Atlantic Diocese</a> 
	which is a part of <a href="https://anglicanchurch.net">the Anglican Church in North 
	America (ACNA).</a></p>
	
	<div id=sac>
	<p>What are Sacraments?</p>
	</div>
	<p>In short sacraments are “Visible signs of an invisible grace”<p>
	<p>The Anglican 39 Articles of Religion states in article 25 that “Sacraments ordained 
		of Christ be not only badges or tokens of Christian men's profession, but rather 
		they be certain sure witnesses, and effectual signs of grace, and God's good will 
		towards us,	by the which he doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, 
		but also strengthen and confirm our Faith in him. There are two sacraments 
		ordained of Christ our Lord in the Gospel, that is to say, Baptism, and the 
		Supper of the Lord.”</p>
	<p>As Anglicans we believe that sacraments are a means of grace. Christ has commanded 
		them, he is the chief actor in them, and he initiates them.  The sacraments, as 
		means of grace, are “highly personal and relational.  They are never mechanical 
		and impersonal.”  Finally they can be understood as conduits of relationship the 
		same way a telephone is a conduit for conversation. We seek to practice the 
		sacraments as part of public worship.</p>
