	<h3>Belonging in Community</h3>
	<hr>
	<p>We are not meant to be orphans, but sin has orphaned us all through disconnecting 
	   us from God, one another, the world, and our own souls. God’s redemptive story is 
	   not only justification by faith, but adoption of orphaned souls into the family of 
	   God. Many people need to experience their belonging before their believing and that
	   is okay.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="value">Prayer:</span> Our relationship with God is one of dependence. Learning to have 
			conversation with God and depend on him is critical to how we live our lives. 
			Praying continually is having a heart tuned to God and life dependent and lead
			by God’s Holy Spirit. (Matt 6:7-13)</li>
		<li><span class="value">City Groups:</span> Our need and desire for community is large, but our relational 
			capacity is far smaller. Intentionally growing community in smaller groups 
			that worship together, grow community, and practice mission is central way 
			that we practice belonging to one another. (Acts 2:42-47)</li>
		<li><span class="value">Life on life:</span> Connecting with others is not someone else’s job, but the work 
			of the whole church. How we will do life is caring for one another and 
			carrying one another’s burdens. Walking with someone helps us know what is 
			really happening in their lives, so rather than be quick to give advice, 
			we will be quick to involve our lives. (Galatians 6:1-5)</li>
		<li><span class="value">Diversity:</span> The kingdom of God is made up of every tribe, tongue, nation, and 
			people. It is often most comfortable to be around people who are most like us 
			and share our tastes, but God reveals himself in the diversity of humanity, 
			so we need others who are different than us to appreciate the fuller picture 
			of who God is. Diversity is God’s design and plan, so we want to celebrate 
			and affirm, and be intentional about giving place to the diversity of our 
			neighborhood in our community life. (Revelation 7:9-12)</li>
